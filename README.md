### Technical Considerations
* User authentication using Firebase.
* The application must have CRUD functionality with the Firebase database.
* Consider encapsulating all Firebase calls into a single module.
* Use SASS to control your color themes.
* Incorporate a CSS grid framework

### Technology Requirements
* SASS 
* Grunt (with JSHINT) 
* Promises
* Browserify
* Grid framework of your choice
* Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
